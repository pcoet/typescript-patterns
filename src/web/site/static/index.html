          Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming
          down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the
          road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo....
        </p>

        <p>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a
          glass: he had a hairy face.
        </p>

        <p>
          He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne
          lived: she sold lemon platt.
        </p>

        <p>
          O, the wild rose blossoms<br>
          On the little green place.
        </p>

        <p>
          He sang that song. That was his song.
