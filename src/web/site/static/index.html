            Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming
            down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the
            road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo....
          </p>
          <p>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a
            glass: he had a hairy face.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne
            lived: she sold lemon platt.
          </p>
          <p>
            O, the wild rose blossoms<br>
            On the little green place.
          </p>
          <p>
            He sang that song. That was his song.
